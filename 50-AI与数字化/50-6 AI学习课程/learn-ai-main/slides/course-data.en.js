This chapter continues from Taste Engineering: first learn to spot (the three states, error prevention and reversibility, flow restraint, conventions), then tighten interface details (which control to pick, how the copy should read), and finally translate interaction requirements for AI (goal-oriented requirements; put the state machine and boundaries in the prompt).

This chapter lays out sixteen psychological effects along the user journey: waiting anxiety, the labor illusion, the peak-end rule, trust calibration, algorithm aversion, defensiveness, the honeymoon cliff, the AI label discount, cognitive offloading, emotional attachment, and on through the pain of paying, pricing anchors, and silence bias.
